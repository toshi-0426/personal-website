# Haskell \#1

Haskell is a pure functional programming language.  
In school class, I learned Haskell for the first time and I was amazed at how easy it is to write quicksort in just a few lines
using list comprehensions.

Here the example of quicksort

```Haskell
qsort :: [Int] -> [Int]
qsort [] = []
qsort (x:xs) =
    qsort [y | y <- xs, x <= y]
    ++ [x]
    ++ qsort [y | y <-xs, x < y]
```

This function recursively sort a list of integers in ascending order.

```haskell
qsort :: [Int] -> [Int]
-- takes a list of integers
-- and returns a new list of integers
```

```haskell
qsort [] = []
-- an empty list is already sorted, so return it
```

```haskell
qsort (x:xs) = …
-- if a list is not empty
-- use pattern matching to split the list into its head x (the pivot) and tail xs.
```

```haskell
qsort [y | y <- xs, y <= x]
-- a list comprehension that collects all elements y from xs that are ≤ the pivot x.
-- call qsort recursively
```

```haskell
x
-- place the pivot x between lower and upper partitions
```

```haskell
qsort [y | y <- xs, y > x]
-- a list comprehension that collects all elements y from xs that are > the pivot x.
-- call qsort recursively
```

Putting it all together, we sort the “lower” partition, then the pivot, then the “upper” partition, concatenating them with ++
