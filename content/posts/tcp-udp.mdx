# Quick Review of UDP/TCP

The following content is a review of TCP and UDP for my own learning purposes.

### Overview of Transport Layer

The Transport Layer plays the crucial role in providing reliable, end-to-end communication between devices on a network.
Its primary functions include ensuring complete data transfer, error recovery, and managing flow control.

### What are UDP and TCP?

UDP and TCP are both protocols in the Transport layer.

- <strong>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Connection-oriented
      <br /> before communications, TCP connection needs to be built between the
      two hosts
    </li>
    <li>Reliable transport</li>
    <li>Slower than UDP</li>
    <li>Full duplex</li>
    <li>Flow Control</li>
    <li>Congestion Control</li>
  </ul>
- <strong>UDP (User Datagram Protocol)</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Connectionless</li>
    <li>Can be unreliable</li>
    <li>No flow control in TCP's way</li>
    <li>Very fast</li>
    <li>
      No guarantees
      <br /> packets can be lost, out of order, or ignored
    </li>
  </ul>
