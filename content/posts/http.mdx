# Quick Review of HTTP

Having studied computer networking at school last year,
I realized how much I’d forgotten.
As I begin my journey with Express.js for backend development,
I find it helpful to review HTTP fundamentals so I fully understand how it works under the hood.

### What is HTTP?

HTTP is a protocol in the application layer that is desined to transfer HTML document basically and also other kind of data such as images, videos, JSON, etc.
Since it requires reliable data delivary, it always runs on top of TCP — which I may cover in more detail in a future blog post.

### HTTP Messages

There are two types of HTTP messages:

- **_Request_** : sent from the client to the server including an HTTP method (e.g. GET, POST), a URL, headers, and optionally a body.
- **_Response_** : sent from the server back to the client including a status code (e.g. 200, 404), headers, and optionally a body.

### Two Key Characteristics of HTTP

- **_Connection Behavior_** <br/>
  HTTP itself is connectionless because without TCP connection, two distince Application layer cannot communicate each other.
  it works together with TCP as I mention earlier and TCP connection can be used for long time period.
  This is called <strong>persistent connection</strong>. <br/>
  For HTTP/1.0, persistant connections are optional. <br/>
  For HTTP/1.1, persistant connections are the defualt. <br/>
  With HTTP/2.0, in addition to persistent connections, efficiency and performance are further improved through features like multiplexing, header compression, and server push.<br/>
- **_Statelessness_** <br />
  HTTP is stateless, meaning every request is independent. <br/>
  The server has no memory of previous interactions — each request must include all necessary information.
