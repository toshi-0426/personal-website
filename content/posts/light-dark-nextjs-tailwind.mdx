# Light/Dark Mode in Next.js + Tailwind CSS

I often refer to this article when implementing light/dark mode in Next.js with Tailwind CSS.
Here’s the link:
[https://www.davegray.codes/posts/light-dark-mode-nextjs-app-router-tailwind](https://www.davegray.codes/posts/light-dark-mode-nextjs-app-router-tailwind)

**Note on Tailwind v4+**  
That guide assumes you have a `tailwind.config.js` file by default. Since Tailwind CSS v4, however, no config is generated unless you explicitly create one.<br/>
So you need to write<br />
`@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark,.dark *));` to the globals.css file.<br/>
For detail, see [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode)

Once that’s set up, just follow the rest of the steps in the article and you’ll be good to go.
